          A Pomodoro Timer is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. The technique
          uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short
          breaks.
          These intervals are known as "pomodoros", the plural in English of the Italian word pomodoro (tomato), after
          the tomato-shaped kitchen timer that Cirillo used as a university student.
